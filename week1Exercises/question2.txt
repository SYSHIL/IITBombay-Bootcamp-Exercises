In this question, we will understand the hardware configuration of your working machine using the /proc filesystem.

1)Run command more /proc/cpuinfo and explain the following terms: processor and cores. Use the command lscpu to verify your definitions.

processor -> gives us the number of processing units our system has, numbering is indexed from 0
cores -> number of cores present


2)How many CPU sockets, cores, and processors does your machine have?

My system has 1 CPU socket which means one physical processor
Each socket has 4 cores and each core has 2 threads running which means we have 8 CPUs

3)What is the frequency of each processor?

Processor frequency(in MHz)
0		900
1 		800
2		1300
3		800
4		1000
5		2800
6		1075
7		800

4)How much memory does your machine have?

cat /proc/meminfo reports amount of available and used memory
memTotal tells us we have 8056088 kB of total memory

5)How much of it is free and available? What is the difference between them?

In our case it is 5678508 kB of Available memory and 3370804 kB of free memory
Available memory is an estimation of how much memory is available for starting new applications, without swapping
Free memory is unused memory ie free = total-used-cache

6)What is the total number of user-level processes in the system?

running ps -e | wc -l tells we have 326 user level processes running in the system

7)What is the total number of number of forks since the boot in the system ?

This can be found out using either cat /proc/stat or vmstat -f 
we have a total number of 8224 forks running on our system


8)How many context switches has the system performed since bootup?

I have ran the vmstat command with a 1 second interval for this,
In the cs column shown in the vmstat output we get the total number of context switches per second
